/**
 * @file src/core/memory/retrieval.ts
 * @description
 * This module is responsible for retrieving relevant memories from the various memory
 * stores when the agent needs to generate a response.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1.  Implementing the composite scoring formula for episodic memory retrieval:
 *     S_i = alpha*R_i + beta*I_i + gamma*cosine(q, e_i) + delta*U_i
 * 2.  Calculating each component of the score (Recency, Importance, Relevance, Usage).
 * 3.  Querying the vector DB for the top N most relevant episodes based on the composite score.
 * 4.  Fetching the corresponding belief nodes that might be relevant.
 * 5.  Incrementing the 'usage' count for retrieved episodes.
