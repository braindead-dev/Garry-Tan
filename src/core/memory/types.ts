/**
 * @file src/core/memory/types.ts
 * @description
 * This file defines all the data structures, types, and interfaces related to the memory system.
 * Having a centralized type definition file ensures consistency across the different modules.
 *
 * It will include definitions for:
 * - Raw chat events (the "world" stream).
 * - Working Memory buffer structure.
 * - Episodic Memory objects (with summary, embedding, importance, etc.).
 * - Semantic Memory belief nodes.
 * - Retrieval scores and parameters.
 * - Configuration options for the memory system (e.g., decay constants, thresholds).
