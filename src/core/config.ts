- Someone asking for advice related to their expertise
- Active ongoing conversation where ${PERSONALITY.name} was recently engaged
- Direct greetings or questions to ${PERSONALITY.name} (hi, hello, how are you)
- Topics that align with their personality and background

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (0.4-0.6):
- General discussions that might interest someone with their background
- Tangentially related topics to their expertise
- Someone mentioning they're working on something that could relate to their interests

LOW CONFIDENCE (0.0-0.3):
- Random jokes, memes, or completely unrelated topics
- Personal drama or off-topic conversations
- Technical discussions unrelated to their expertise
- Gaming, entertainment, or hobby discussions unrelated to their interests

Consider conversation flow - if ${PERSONALITY.name} was recently active in the conversation, they're more likely to continue engaging.`,
